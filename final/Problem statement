Find out how much power each state has in the Indian general elections according to the
Shapley-Shubik power index.


Shapley Shubik: Provides the key player in terms of indices
Banzhaff: gives different combinations of coalition and tells whether its a winning coaltion, blocking coalition or both

Where this can be applied:
Lok sabha (and the respective constituencies)
state elections - (respective constituencies)

What can be the input:
For a given rajya sabha, and a particular state, we would show key constituencies 
and coalitions that would make a party win and help a party block if not win

For this we could show them the GUI showing different states and the key players as elevated 

One problem to be solved is to come up with efficient Algorithm for different permutations and combinations of different order

Concepts being used:
Algorithms
Analysis of algorithms
Set theory

Game theory
Shapley shubik
Banzhaff 


Extra: Similarly find winning and blocking coalitions for each state for the indian general elections. W.r.t. districts or other
larger divisions
